# Awesome-OpenSees  [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

Hi, this is a curated list of OpenSees resources. You may find something awesome that gives you a better experience using or developing OpenSees. OpenSees, the abbreviation for "the Open System for Earthquake Engineering Simulation", is an object-oriented open-source software framework, allowing users to create both serial and parallel finite element computer applications for simulating the response of structural and geotechnical systems subjected to earthquakes and other hazards. Here is a link to [OpenSees official wiki website](http://opensees.berkeley.edu/wiki/index.php/Main_Page).

This awesome-list project is inspired by the project [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome). However, as OpenSees itself is rapidly growing, most of the related resources are not so mature. Therefore, the resources listed here may suffer from some limitations, or still under development but inspiring. The author doesn't take any responsibility for the accuracy of anything listed. You should judge whether to use them by yourself.

Contributing to the list is encouraged. Please read the [contribution guidelines](contributing.md) before making pull requests.

## Graphical Processor
User-friendly graphical pre- and post-processors for OpenSees.

* [GiD+OpenSees](http://gidopensees.rclab.civil.auth.gr/) - An OpenSees add-on for [GiD](https://www.gidhome.com/download/), A general graphical pre/post processor. (Windows, MacOS & Linux)
* [NextFEM](http://www.nextfem.it/it/home/) - A user friendly Finite Element Analysis program, which can be used alone or to be a pre- or post- processor for several widely used FEM programs (i.e. OOFEM, SAP2000, Midas GEN, OpenSees, ABAQUS/CalculiX, Zeus-NL, and others). (Windows only)
* [OpenSees Navigator](http://openseesnavigator.berkeley.edu/) - A stand-alone Matlab interface allowing users to quickly create models, perform analysis, and look at the results. (Windows & MacOS, `Matlab Compiler Runtime` needed)
* [ETO (Etabs To OpenSees)](http://www.dinochen.com/article.asp?id=149) - A pre- and post-processor which is able to import `.s2k` file generated by ETABS. (Windows only, in Chinese)

## Stand-Alone Editor
Stand-alone editor programs just for OpenSees code.

* [Cypress Editor](http://cypress.hrshojaie.com/en-us/default.aspx) - A better editor for who does OpenSees code. (Windows only)

## Editor Plugin
OpenSees plugins for existing welcomed text editors.

* [Sublime-OpenSees](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/OpenSees) - A [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) plug-in for the OpenSees extension language of TCL. (Windows, MacOS & Linux)
* [OpenSEESAutoComplete](https://github.com/Hanlin-Dong/OpenSEESAutoComplete) - An auto-complete plugin to make writing OpenSees file easier on [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/). (Windows only)
* [Atom Language Package](https://github.com/jamesmaguire/language-opensees) - An [Atom](https://atom.io/) text editor package that provides syntax highlighting and auto-completion for OpenSees tcl scripts.
* [VSCode Language Support](https://github.com/jamesmaguire/vscode-language-opensees) - An extension that adds rich language support for OpenSees flavoured TCL language in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Visualiser
Simple scripts that help visualise OpenSees models or results.

* [OpenSees Model View](https://github.com/jamesmaguire/opensees-model-view) - A Python package that can be used to visualise your OpenSees model as the tcl file is written.
* [OpenSees 3D Visualisation](https://github.com/jamesmaguire/opensees-3d-visualisation) - A Python script that reads OpenSees simulation input and output files to create a 3D visualisation of your displaced model.
* [OpenSees Model Plotter Matlab](https://github.com/gerardjoreilly/OpenSees-Model-Plotter-Matlab) - A Matlab-based plotter for models developed in OpenSees.

## API
Application Programming Interfaces that call OpenSees.

* [OpenSeesAPI](https://github.com/nassermarafi/OpenSeesAPI) - A Python package that is used to write OpenSees tcl scripts quickly.
* [OpenSeesAPI.m](https://github.com/andrewdsen/OpenSeesAPI.m) - An OpenSees API for MATLAB.
* [Script Generation via Templates](https://github.com/ucgmsim/OpenSees_script-generation) - An inspiring example of using Python template engine [Jinjia2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/) to generate massive tcl scripts.

## Procedure and Snippet
Reuseable procedures and snippets. All the files are stored in the `tcl` directory.
